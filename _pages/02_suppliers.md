First, it's important to understand that Meshtastic radios are only now emerging into the enthusiast/hobbyist market. Even the off-the-shelf turn-key products are not up to typical name-brand commercial standards. Many are manufactured, sold, and shipped from Asian markets making consumer support on such things largely community drive and supported.

Keep in mind the nature of these products, which are decidedly maturing rapidly, but do not rise to the standards, yet, of mainstream consumer electronics.

**This is by not a comprehensive list. New hardware is being released all the time as new vendors enter the market. For an always up to date list of compatible hardware platforms always check the [Meshtastic Hardware Support page](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/).**

> **In the United States, the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical radio frequency has been designated as 915mhz. If meant for use in the US, always purchase a radio designated for the 915mhz band!**

Your best bet for an off-the-shelf, ready-to-use unit. Small form factor makes for ease of use, at the price of radio performance. A good entry level choice to start your Meshtastic journey!
## [LillyGo T-Deck](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-deck)
<img src="/media/LILYGO-T-DECK_15.webp" width="50%"> 

A newer offering that tries to emulate a Blackberry style handheld. I've been led to believe there are some rough edges to the user experience that are slowly being ironed out by the community.
## [LillyGo T-Watch](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-watch-s3)

A "smart-watch" stand-in that can likewise serve as a Meshtastic client.

A development board, optionally ships with a plastic case. You will still need to provide a battery, so this is a partial DIY.

The kit to buy if you are building your own. Modular options for a wide array of add-on environmental sensors. This is a board only, so will need a custom DIY build to make use of.
## [Rockland LLC](https://store.rokland.com/pages/meshtastic-hardware-rak-lilygo)

Rockland is a US based re-seller for many of the Asian manufacturers. Prices may appear, at first glance, to be slightly higher than ordering direct. However, their in-stock items ship direct from a US warehouse and arrive quite quickly. They're well regarded as a friendly US based supplier who's happy to work with hobbyists such as ourselves.
## A Note about Resellers

 You will likely find a good number of these for sale on secondary marketplaces, like E-Bay, Amazon, Etsy, and similar. Outside of the aforementioned Rockland, there are no additional official resellers based in the US. Be cautious about who and what you are ordering if you decide to purchase from an unofficial third party supplier. If you receive a defective, or incorrect item from one of these un-official resellers, you may not have and recourse!
