 no, but it is a little bit of all those things...

How about the *Blue Knob **Everything** Radio Network*???

...let's just call it the **B.E.R.N.**<img src="/media/transparent_check.png">

*Greetings, **Citizen**!*

Do you have a way to keep in-touch with friends and neighbors in the event of an extended power outage? 
 
What about a loss of internet or cell phone coverage? We all know too well how unreliable cellular service is on Blue Knob.

What if phone, internet, and power were all down at the same time?

Do you want to have a backup communications in the event of an emergency?

Do you want to take command of your own localized, community driven, network that doesn't rely on cellular, internet, or residential electrical services?

Or would you like a platform on which to gossip about...well, just about anything, in full privacy from the prying eyes of *everyone*?

# The BERN Mesh
The **BERN** is a *user generated* radio network using the open-source [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) routing protocol to ensure long-range delivery of text based messages over the air. With maximum theoretical range of 250km, each node of the **BERN** extends the reach, range, and reliability of the entire network. The more people who use it, the more powerful and reliable it becomes.

In the above mesh network diagram, all nodes are connected to the mesh but some nodes are not connected to one another. For example, there's no way for **A** to talk directly to **D** or **C**. The mesh routing will forward **A's** messages to **E** and **B** which **do** have connection to **C** and **D**...and the message is delivered. Larger mesh networks may see multiple hops across multiple nodes before messages propagate to their final destination.

## Is this like HAM Radio?
![It's nothing like a HAM radio!](/media/Ham_Radio.png)

No, the radio frequencies utilized by the BERN mesh require no licensing by the FCC. We utilize a 915mhz frequency band, with a legally capped transmission power of just one watt. In a mesh network, every node on the network is both transmitter and repeater. So small, short range signals may hop from node to node, creating far greater distances and coverage than typical point to point radios.

## Probably Costs a Bundle, Right?

You can purchase a turn-key solution (no I am not selling them, this is not a commercial site!), for ~$60 or build your own for as little as $35. The price of entry is not expensive, and there is no infrastructure required to maintain other than a little radio unit small enough to fit in a shirt pocket!

## Sounds Sketchy, Who's Listening?
![FOR YOUR PROTECTION](/media/snooping.jpg)

The **BERN** may be thought of as a series of chat-rooms. Users may self-configure their own private channels, or utilize public "clear" channels. Private and direct messaging channels are protected by [AES256 encryption](https://www.atpinc.com/blog/what-is-aes-256-encryption), the same strength utilized by your bank to perform financial transactions.

In short, the only people who can "hear" you on the **BERN** are those who you want to allow to do so. You create your own keys for your own rooms, and only those who you've given those keys to may communicate on those channels. It's all in your control.

## Location & Telemetry
![GPS data relayed to the Mesh](/media/gps-1826792_1920-1.png)

In addition to basic text messaging, the mesh radios may optionally contain any number of environmental sensors. The data produced by these sensors may, optionally, be broadcast to the mesh.

![Weather Station](/media/TransparentWeather.png)

Think about a stationary node with a suite of weather sensors...this becomes a de facto community weather station for the entire mesh.

![Dog Tracker](/media/dogtracker.jpg)

Consider attaching a radio with an on-board GPS receiver to a fast moving target, like an ornery dog. Now you've got a real-time GPS tracking system overlaid with Google maps so you'll never lose your dog...or your kids again!

## Beyond the Knob
![And Beyond!](/media/connected-world.webp)

The Meshtastic protocol has been widely deployed across multiple nations in multiple continents. Many cities host burgeoning mesh networks, all user created and maintained. Your **BERN** radio is fully functional on **any** meshtastic network. The Blue Knob network is geographically isolated, but the more users who are on the network, the wider ranging and more robust it will become.

Presently, we are able to make tenuous communication between the residential areas at Blue Knob and the Bedford Street/Post Office area of Claysburg. It is hoped this can be extended even further as more nodes join the network.

Your investment in the **BERN** is something that can be used anywhere on Planet Earth, as it doesn't rely on any additional infrastructure other than what you hold in your hand.
